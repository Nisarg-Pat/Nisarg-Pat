# Hello World
I am a software engineer graduated with Master of Science in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts where I worked as a Graduate Teaching Assistant for Algorithms. I grew up in India, where I completed my Bachelors in Information and Communication Technology with minor in Computational Science from DAIICT in 2019. 

Post undergrad, I worked for 2 years as R&D Software Engineer at Samsung Research Institute in New Delhi, India. For my contributions to the Email application at Samsung, I received Employee of the Quarter Award (July - September, 2020). I was also proud to clear the Samsung Software Proficiency Exam - Professional Level.
